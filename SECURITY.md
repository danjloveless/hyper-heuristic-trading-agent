# Security Guide for QuantumTrade AI

This document outlines security best practices and considerations for deploying the QuantumTrade AI system.

## üîê Security Overview

The QuantumTrade AI system is designed with security in mind, implementing multiple layers of protection for both development and production environments.

## üö® Critical Security Requirements

### 1. Environment Variables
**NEVER commit sensitive information to version control.** All sensitive data should be managed through environment variables:

```bash
# Required environment variables
export CLICKHOUSE_PASSWORD="your-secure-password"
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="your-aws-access-key"
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="your-aws-secret-key"
export JWT_SECRET="your-jwt-secret-key"
export API_KEY_SECRET="your-api-key-secret"
```

### 2. AWS Credentials
- Use AWS IAM roles with minimal required permissions
- Never hardcode AWS credentials in configuration files
- Use AWS Secrets Manager for sensitive configuration
- Enable AWS CloudTrail for audit logging

### 3. Database Security
- Use strong, unique passwords for all databases
- Enable encryption at rest and in transit
- Restrict network access using security groups
- Regularly rotate database credentials

### 4. API Security
- Implement rate limiting on all public endpoints
- Use JWT tokens with short expiration times
- Validate all input data
- Implement CORS policies appropriately

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Features Implemented

### Infrastructure Security
- **VPC Isolation**: All resources deployed in private subnets
- **Security Groups**: Restrictive firewall rules
- **Encryption**: S3 buckets and databases encrypted at rest
- **IAM Roles**: Least privilege access for ECS tasks

### Application Security
- **Input Validation**: All API endpoints validate input
- **Rate Limiting**: Per-user and per-endpoint limits
- **CORS**: Configurable cross-origin policies
- **Logging**: Comprehensive audit logging

### Data Security
- **Encryption**: Data encrypted in transit and at rest
- **Access Control**: Role-based access to sensitive data
- **Audit Trail**: All data access logged and monitored

## üîß Security Configuration

### Local Development
1. Create a `.env` file (never commit this):
```bash
CLICKHOUSE_PASSWORD=your-dev-password
REDIS_PASSWORD=your-dev-redis-password
JWT_SECRET=your-dev-jwt-secret
```

2. Use Docker secrets for sensitive data:
```bash
echo "your-secret" | docker secret create db_password -
```

### Production Deployment
1. Use AWS Secrets Manager:
```bash
aws secretsmanager create-secret \
    --name "quantumtrade/database" \
    --description "Database credentials" \
    --secret-string '{"password":"your-secure-password"}'
```

2. Configure ECS task definitions to use secrets:
```json
{
  "secrets": [
    {
      "name": "DB_PASSWORD",
      "valueFrom": "arn:aws:secretsmanager:region:account:secret:quantumtrade/database"
    }
  ]
}
```

## üö´ Security Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### ‚ùå Never Do This:
- Hardcode passwords in source code
- Use default passwords
- Expose internal services to the internet
- Store secrets in version control
- Use weak encryption algorithms
- Skip input validation
- Disable security headers

### ‚úÖ Always Do This:
- Use environment variables for secrets
- Implement proper authentication
- Validate all user inputs
- Use HTTPS in production
- Keep dependencies updated
- Monitor for security vulnerabilities
- Implement proper logging

## üîç Security Monitoring

### Log Monitoring
- Monitor application logs for suspicious activity
- Set up alerts for failed authentication attempts
- Track API usage patterns
- Monitor database access logs

### Vulnerability Scanning
- Regularly scan Docker images for vulnerabilities
- Update dependencies with security patches
- Use automated security testing in CI/CD
- Conduct regular security audits

### Incident Response
- Document incident response procedures
- Set up security alerting
- Maintain contact information for security team
- Regular security training for team members

## üìã Security Checklist

Before deploying to production:

- [ ] All secrets moved to environment variables
- [ ] AWS credentials properly configured
- [ ] Database passwords changed from defaults
- [ ] Security groups configured correctly
- [ ] SSL/TLS certificates installed
- [ ] Rate limiting enabled
- [ ] Input validation implemented
- [ ] Logging configured
- [ ] Monitoring alerts set up
- [ ] Backup procedures tested
- [ ] Disaster recovery plan documented
