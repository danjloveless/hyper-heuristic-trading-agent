## Key Data Flows

### Primary Prediction Flow
1. **Market Data** → Data Ingestion → Feature Engineering → ML Inference → Prediction Service → API Gateway
2. **News Data** → Sentiment Analysis → Feature Engineering → ML Inference
3. **Performance Feedback** → Performance Evaluation → Strategy Optimization → Hyper Heuristic

### Real-time Flow
1. **Live Market Data** → Stream Processor → Redis → Feature Engine → WebSocket Service
2. **Real-time Predictions** → WebSocket Service → Client Applications

### Training Flow
1. **Historical Data** → Feature Engineering → Model Training Pipeline → TensorRT Models → Inference Engine

## Inter-Module Communication

### Synchronous Communication (REST APIs)

- Symbol-based sharding for Redis
- Model versioning for A/B testing

## Security Architecture

### Authentication Flow
1. Client → API Gateway → Authentication Service → JWT Token
2. Service-to-service communication via API keys
3. Database access via IAM roles

### Data Security

## Development Guidelines

### Module Independence
- Each module has its own repository/directory
- Clearly defined API contracts
- Independent testing and deployment
- Versioned interfaces

### Data Contracts
- Standardized data formats across modules
- Schema evolution support
- Backward compatibility requirements
- API versioning strategy

### Performance Requirements
- Sub-20ms prediction latency
- 99.9% availability target
- Auto-scaling based on demand
- Efficient resource utilization

This modular architecture ensures that each component can be developed, tested, and deployed independently while maintaining system cohesion and performance requirements.
